	<h2 class='character-title'>Benjamin Taylor Skylark:</h2>
	<p class= 'character-p'>Ben was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Like the other dwellers he found his way to 
		this new world and has quickly made a new life for himself. Ben harbors a secret that he 
		keeps from all but his most trusted friends. He is secretly Taylor Skyfeather, the King
		of Thieves. 
	</p>
	<p class= 'character-p'>As the King of Thieves it is up to Taylor to keep control over the criminal networks of
		Palanthas. He is renown as the man who will get things done if needed. However, when
		he first met the dwellers he introduced himself as Squire Ben, of the Knights of Palanthas.
		Quickly he grew close to the dwellers, Roman in particular, and traveled with them.

	<p class= 'character-p'>What is in store for our Paladin/Thief? Only time will tell.</p>
